# Task Manager

A modern PHP task manager with JSON-based storage, featuring a glassmorphism UI, smooth animations, and mobile-responsive design. Built to demonstrate clean PHP coding, Tailwind CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity for a portfolio project.

## Features
- Create tasks with validation to prevent duplicates and empty inputs.
- Edit tasks via an animated modal with zoom-in effects.
- Toggle task completion with status-based colors (emerald for completed, amber for pending).
- Delete tasks with confirmation prompts.
- Glassmorphism design with vibrant gradients, pulse effects, and subtle shadows.
- Animations include task slide-in, modal zoom-in, and loading spinners.
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop devices.
- Persistent storage using a JSON file (`tasks.json`).

## Setup
1. Place `todo.php` in a PHP-enabled server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a web host).
2. Ensure the directory has write permissions to create and modify `tasks.json`.
3. Access the app via a browser (e.g., `http://localhost/todo.php`).

## Tech Stack
- **PHP**: Backend logic and JSON file handling.
- **JSON**: Lightweight data storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, modern styling with glassmorphism.
- **JavaScript**: Modal interactions and spinner animations.

## Usage
- Add tasks using the input form.
- Edit or delete tasks via buttons on each task card.
- Toggle task completion with checkboxes.
- Enjoy a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop.

## Notes
- Ensure server write permissions for `tasks.json` to avoid storage issues.
- The project is optimized for simplicity and portfolio showcasing but can be extended with features like task categories or dark mode.
